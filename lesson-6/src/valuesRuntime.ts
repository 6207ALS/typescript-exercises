// TS240 Introduction to TypeScript | Lesson 6
// Practice Problems: Object Values at Runtime


// Q1
/*
The provided code will not raise any errors at runtime. However, this practice, 
using "readonly" and "ReadonlyArray" properties, goes against the purpose of 
TypeScript's type safety.
The "userSettings" object has been mutated, even though it was defined not to be
by TypeScript.
The output of the code will be "light" and "["email", "push", "sms"]".
