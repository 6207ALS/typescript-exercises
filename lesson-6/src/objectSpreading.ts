// Q1
/*
The provided code will not raise an error when compiled in TypeScript. The
"Combined" interface is defined as a combination of the "Person" and "Address"
interface properties along with a "phone" property.
The constant "combined" follows the type definition of type "Combined". It
utilizes the object spread operator to define its "Person" and "Address"
related properties. It also defines a phone property.
